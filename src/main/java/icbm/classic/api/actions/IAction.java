     * Actions should always be instant. If something needs to run over several ticks then it should
     * spawn a thread, listener, entity, or other system. This way actions can stay simple and not
     * require callbacks. If a callback is still needed... consider a status obj that provides access to
     * what was created.
     *
     * When running action make sure to push through event listeners. Allowing external systems to intercept
     * and validate if action is good to complete. This will especially be useful in cases of world editing.
