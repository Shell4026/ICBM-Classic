/**<pre>
 * List of types to better describe actions. Different conditions can be combined to create outcomes downstream.
 *
 * Types are color coded for easy usage downstream. {@link #RED} means no, {@link #YELLOW} & {@link #GREEN} are yes
 *
 * {@link #RED} is not meant to be a stop condition for a machine. It is meant to say something is likely wrong and
 * a user should be given pause. Machines may implement this as the user needing to bypass safety or confirm action.
 *
 * {@link #BLOCKING} is the actual stop condition that prevent logic from continuing. When this is provided in a
 * status then the user, process, or anything shouldn't continue. Most errors often combine this to prevent user
 * from making mistakes or when code can't continue due to missing data.
 *
 * {@link #YELLOW} is a softer version of {@link #RED} that should be considered as yes continue. Think of traffic
 * lights that indicate continue slowly.
 *
 * {@link #GREEN} is directly equal to yes in any boolean check. It may come in different flavors to better
 * describe actions and how to respond. However, all sub-types should be viewed as 'everything is good'
 *
 * Examples:
 *  {@link #ERROR} + {@link #READY} -> machine is in an error state but can still be forced to continue
 *  {@link #CAUTION} + {@link #READY} -> machine has a soft error that can be ignored and will likely work fine.
