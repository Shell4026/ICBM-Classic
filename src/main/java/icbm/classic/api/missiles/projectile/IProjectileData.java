/**
 * Information about a projectile, usually wrapper for an entity or entity spawn system. Provides
 * the type of projectile, what systems it can work with, and how to place the projectile into the world.
 *
 * Projectile system exists as a way to abstract entity from system. Allowing content, such as cluster, to
 * list supported projectiles and store them in a safe data structure. Where the entity can be spawned when
 * needed without knowing what it is or how it works.
 *
 * @param <E> created from the projectile data
 *
 * @deprecated being replaced with {@link icbm.classic.api.actions.IActionData} and {@link icbm.classic.api.actions.data.ActionTypes#PROJECTILE}
 * as current solution isn't flexible enough and results in odd spawning when {@link #onEntitySpawned(Entity, Entity, EnumHand)} is invoked. It
 * also gives caller too much visibility into what is spawned. When it should just provide starting information via {@link icbm.classic.api.actions.data.IActionFieldProvider}
 * then let the spawn entity use what it needs. Plus this makes it far easier for reuse of common actions and provide implemetation for other mods.
 * As the majority of projects can be implemented as ActionSpawnEntity((world, pos, provider) -> new Entity(world, pos, provider)). Dropping
 * need for a custom implementation.
