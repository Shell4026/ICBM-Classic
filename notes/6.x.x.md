# Notes for active work on action rewrite

## Issues

* missile render flickers... likely caused by the item render changes made for parachute

## Current work

* Finish action listener system
* Create base implementation for IPotentialAction, likely can get away with a field for conditional and IActionData
* Have IPotentialAction call through listener system
* Finish creating hook block
* Add IPoentialAction to hook block
* Add conditionals for hook block, likely just need timer
* Create registry for conditionals and add timer to it
* Add action for updating redstone, if this can't be done just have hook emit redstone
* register action status for blast

## Future work

* need to rewrite launcher to use IPoential Action
* rework blasts that are threaded to spawn off a watcher from an action
* rework blasts to use a fake explosive instance instead of extending
* push ticking blasts off to entities or other systems that don't connect back to blast
